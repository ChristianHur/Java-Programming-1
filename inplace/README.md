# In-Place Algorithms

An **in-place algorithm** is one that transforms or mutates data without incurring additional memory space during the process.

Some of the most common scenarios involve array and list manipulations.

Included in this demo are four in-place algorithms to reverse an array of integers and strings.  

Enjoy and happy coding!
